\part{The State of the Art and the Future of Brain-Inspired AI}

\section{Current Frontiers in Explainable Neural Networks for Neuroscience}

The XAI tools and approaches detailed in the previous part are essential for interpreting trained AI models. Current frontiers, however, are not only about post-hoc explanation but also involve developing AI in ways that are intrinsically more aligned with neuroscientific inquiry or that enable novel experimental paradigms. One such frontier is the sophisticated use of generative models for ``in silico'' experiments. Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), learn the underlying distribution of data and can synthesize new data samples. In the context of Neuroscience, these models are increasingly employed to create optimized or novel stimuli designed to maximally activate specific artificial neurons within a neural network model, or even to predict stimuli that would maximally drive responses in biological neurons or entire brain regions \cite{olah2018building}. This technique, often referred to as activation maximization or feature visualization, allows researchers to go beyond merely observing what features a model has learned and actively probe what specific patterns or combinations of features are most salient for particular units or representations. For instance, if a model of the visual cortex learns a specific representation, generative methods can synthesize the ``ideal'' visual input for that representation, providing a concrete, visual hypothesis about its tuning properties. These synthetic stimuli can then, in turn, be used in actual neurophysiological experiments, creating a powerful feedback loop between computational modeling and empirical investigation \cite{richards2019deep, kriegeskorte2018cognitive}. This allows for more targeted and efficient experimentation than relying solely on pre-defined stimulus sets, potentially uncovering unexpected feature selectivity.

While generative models provide powerful means to probe the learned representations of neural networks, another critical frontier concerns how such rich, potentially brain-like representations are acquired, especially considering the learning constraints of biological systems. This leads to investigations beyond predominantly supervised learning paradigms. The brain, particularly during early development, excels at learning from largely unlabeled or sparsely labeled data. Consequently, there is growing interest in self-supervised learning (SSL) and unsupervised learning (UL) for creating AI models that might develop more brain-like representations \cite{richards2019deep}. SSL methods, for example, create supervisory signals from the data itself (e.g., by predicting a missing part of an input, or learning to be invariant to certain transformations), while UL aims to discover inherent structure, like clusters or principal components, in the data without any explicit labels. Models trained with these paradigms are hypothesized to capture the statistical regularities of their input environment in a manner more akin to how biological sensory systems operate. The resulting representations can be more robust, generalizable, and potentially more aligned with the rich, multifaceted representations found in the brain, which are not solely optimized for a single, narrowly defined task. Exploring these learning frameworks is crucial for developing AI that not only performs well but also learns in a way that could offer deeper insights into the principles of neural learning and development.

The development of models using self-supervised or unsupervised learning, which aim for more biologically plausible representational learning, is indicative of a broader trend: the rise of ``Neuro-AI.'' This research field is explicitly dedicated to fostering a deeper, synergistic relationship between Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence, moving beyond unidirectional inspiration towards a virtuous cycle of discovery \cite{richards2019deep, kriegeskorte2018cognitive}. In this paradigm, neuroscientific findings about brain architecture (e.g., distinct processing pathways, recurrent connectivity), learning rules (e.g., Hebbian plasticity, synaptic consolidation), and computational principles (e.g., predictive coding, sparse representations, attention mechanisms) directly inform the design of new AI architectures and algorithms. These more biologically-inspired or constrained AI systems are then leveraged not only for technological advancement but also as more plausible and testable computational models of brain function. By meticulously comparing the behavior and internal dynamics of these Neuro-AI models with neural and behavioral data, researchers can refine their understanding of the brain. This, in turn, generates new, empirically testable hypotheses that can feed back into the development of even more sophisticated AI, ultimately aiming for models that are both performant and mechanistically interpretable in a way that resonates with biological reality.

The ambitions of Neuro-AI, seeking to bridge the gap between artificial systems and biological intelligence, find a particularly compelling and rapidly evolving testbed in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential to simulate complex thought processes. These models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in processing and generating human language, and more recently, in tasks that seem to require reasoning, planning, and problem-solving \cite{wei2022chain}. The emergence of such capabilities has spurred intense investigation into whether and how these models might be ``simulating'' or even instantiating aspects of human thought. XAI techniques are vital in this endeavor, as researchers attempt to peer inside these vast networks to understand the basis of their performance. For example, studies analyzing the effect of ``chain-of-thought'' prompting, where models are encouraged to output intermediate reasoning steps, suggest that LLMs can indeed follow and articulate a form of step-by-step reasoning \cite{wei2022chain}. Furthermore, by comparing the internal representational spaces of LLMs with brain activity patterns recorded while humans perform language tasks, researchers have found intriguing alignments, suggesting some convergence in how linguistic information is structured \cite{caucheteux2022brains, toneva2019interpreting}. However, this is an area of active debate and research, particularly concerning the extent to which these abilities reflect genuine understanding versus sophisticated pattern matching, and how language capabilities relate to broader cognitive thought \cite{mahowald2023dissociating, binz2023using}. Investigating LLMs through a cognitive lens, including their operational mechanisms, limitations, and biases, offers a novel platform for generating hypotheses about the mechanisms of human reasoning, language comprehension, and their intricate interplay.
